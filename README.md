```bash
python generate_pdf.py
```

**Generate PDF for a specific county:**
```bash
python generate_pdf.py BOUNDARY
python generate_pdf.py KOOTENAI
```

The PDF generator will:
1. Read the JSON file for the specified county
2. Create an 8.5x11" PDF with photo grid layout
3. Display photos (~1.5" wide) with names and offense classifications
4. Save to `<county>_county_offenders.pdf`

```json
[
  {
    "name": "DOE, JOHN MICHAEL",
    "kno": "8001234",
    "address": "123 MAIN ST",

    ]
  }
]
```

### PDF Report Layout

The PDF report features:
- **Header**: County name and generation date on each page
- **Photo Grid**: 5 columns √ó 3 rows (15 offenders per page)
- **Each Entry Shows**:
  - Full-resolution photo (~1.5" wide)
  - Full name
  - Offense classification (in red, bold)
  - City of residence
- **Page Numbers**: Bottom right of each page

### Offense Classifications

The system automatically categorizes offenses into the following types:

- **CP** - Child Pornography (possession of materials)
- **CHILD SA** - Child Sexual Assault/Abuse (offenses against minors)
- **RAPE** - Rape (adult victims)
- **SA** - Sexual Assault (adult victims)
- **EXPLOIT** - Exploitation/Enticement of minors
- **ASSAULT** - Assault with intent/Kidnapping
- **EXPOSURE** - Indecent Exposure
- **OTHER-SEX** - Other sexual offenses
- **OTHER** - Non-sexual offenses

The classification is based on analyzing offense descriptions for keywords related to:
- Age indicators (U/16, UNDER 14, MINOR, CHILD, etc.)
- Offense types (LEWD, MOLESTATION, RAPE, etc.)
- Material possession (PORNOGRAPHY, EXPLICIT IMAGES, etc.)

## Configuration

### Changing the County

Both scripts accept a county name as a command-line argument:

```bash
# Scrape data
python scraper.py <COUNTY_NAME>

# Generate PDF
python generate_pdf.py <COUNTY_NAME>
```

### Valid Idaho Counties

Some common Idaho counties:
- ADA
- BANNOCK
- BONNER
- BONNEVILLE
- BOUNDARY
- CANYON
- KOOTENAI
- LATAH
- NEZ PERCE
- TWIN FALLS

(The system accepts any valid Idaho county name)

### Customizing the PDF Layout

You can modify these values in `generate_pdf.py`:

```python
self.photo_width = 1.5 * inch        # Width of each photo
self.photo_height = 2 * inch         # Height of each photo
self.photos_per_row = 5              # Photos per row
```

The script automatically calculates how many rows fit on each page based on available space.

- Verify image URLs are accessible
- Check your internet connection

### JSON parsing errors
- Ensure you have the latest version of BeautifulSoup4
- Check that the HTML structure hasn't changed on the source website
- Verify the JSON file isn't corrupted

### PDF generation fails
- Ensure the JSON file exists for the specified county
- Check that ReportLab and Pillow are installed correctly
- Verify image files exist in the correct directory
- Check available disk space

### County-specific issues
- Verify the county name is correct (use uppercase)
- Some counties may have no registered offenders
- Check the Idaho SOR website to confirm data exists for that county

## Example Workflow

**Complete workflow for multiple counties:**

```bash
# Scrape multiple counties
python scraper.py BONNER
python scraper.py BOUNDARY
python scraper.py KOOTENAI

# Generate PDFs for all counties
python generate_pdf.py BONNER
python generate_pdf.py BOUNDARY
python generate_pdf.py KOOTENAI
```

This will create:
- 3 JSON files with complete data
- 3 PDF reports ready for printing
- Organized image directories for each county
